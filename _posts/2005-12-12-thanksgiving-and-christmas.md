It has been almost a month since my last entry. Time seems to have been flying.

Thanksgiving was fun, my brother and his girlfriend stayed in Orlando with me and we cooked up a nice meal. As a matter of fact, some of it is still in the fridge waiting to be eaten.

Since I missed posting on Thanksgiving as I had planned, I will note some things I&#8217;m thankful for. I&#8217;m thankful for my friends and family, with out them I&#8217;d be one lonely guy. I&#8217;m grateful for having food and a roof over my head along with plenty of things to make life enjoyable. We often get caught up in what we don&#8217;t have and forget we have much more than we really need to survive. Most of all, I&#8217;m thankful for God&#8217;s gift to us, His Son, Jesus.

Recently I&#8217;ve come to realize that thanksgiving is a wonderful precursor to Christmas. It only seems appropriate to give thanks for what God has done for us and what He has provided and to follow that up with a celebration of the ultimate gift.
