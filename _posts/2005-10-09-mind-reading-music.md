I was going to write about what I did today but instead I will leave you with these thoughts.

I was driving in my car today, with a mix disc when some older Third Day music came on. I was listening to the Time album in the car, which is one of my favorite Third Day albums but, now that I&#8217;m at the computer, I&#8217;m listening to Conspiracy No. 5. I think so far every song that has come one speaks to how I feel about some area of my life.

Some songs that have stood out are below:

How&#8217;s Your Head?
  
Third Day
  
How&#8217;s your head? I&#8217;m so sorry
  
That I can&#8217;t do anything about it
  
Like I said, I&#8217;ll be praying
  
Here without you I feel helpless

Sorry I had to go away
  
Tomorrow&#8217;s just another day
  
without you here, I&#8217;ll have to say
  
Hold on to love

How&#8217;s your day? Do you miss me?
  
Right now I&#8217;ve only a minute
  
Called to say, I&#8217;m so sorry
  
And once again I feel helpless

God forbid we&#8217;d be apart
  
How close or shall I ask how far
  
are we until the demise of this helplessness

A part of &#8220;Alien:&#8221;
  
Keep your watch over me
  
Sustain the life in me
  
Frustrate the ways of every wicked man
  
Let me inside your home
  
Father defend my cause
  
Plead for my case and my innocence
  
Just like the alien,
  
I&#8217;m a stranger in a strange land
  
Just like the fatherless I am in need
  
of someone to take my hand
  
Just like the widow,
  
I need you right now to understand and save me.

Have Mercy
  
Third Day
  
My will won&#8217;t break, it barely bends
  
Same old sinner, the same old sin
  
On my knees to plead again
  
Confessions trial, where to begin?

Have mercy, on me a sinning man
  
Lord have mercy, on me a sinning man

From &#8220;This song was meant for you:&#8221;
  
You never know what the future holds for you
  
But of all I have heard this on thing&#8217;s true
  
Nothing can separate us from God&#8217;s love
  
In our lives there is abound to come some pain
  
Surely as there are storms and falling rain
  
Just believe that the one who holds the storms
  
Will bring the sun

Finally, from &#8220;Your love endures:&#8221;
  
Though the seasons change With the passing time
  
Your love endures forever
  
And the sun will fade If just for the night
  
Your love endures forever

Though our pains and joys Will come and go
  
Your love endures forever
  
Even in my fears I will always know
  
That your love endures forever&#8230;
