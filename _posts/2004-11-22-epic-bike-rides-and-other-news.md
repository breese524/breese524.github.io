I have found out by word of mouth that the San Felasco ride is full. So that leaves the IDIDARIDE and maybe the 6 hr. Carter team race for January.

In February there is the 12 hrs. of Razorback team race. I don&apos;t know what is going on further down the road, but I&apos;m keeping my ears open for what&apos;s happening.

In other news I&apos;m thinking of starting my actual web site and using <a href="wordpress.org">WordPress</a> or something similar to handle my journaling needs.
