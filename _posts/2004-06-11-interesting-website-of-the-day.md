In my quest to find something interesting to post almost daily, I came across the Google Zeitgeist at: http://www.google.com/press/zeitgeist.html. The Zeitgeist is basically a listing of top searches from around the world. From this I found that in Australia there seems to be a somewhat popular TV show called My Restaurant Rules (www.myrestaurantrules.com.au/).
