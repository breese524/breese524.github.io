Well, there&apos;s a lion on the loose in central Florida. Heres the URL to the news story: http://www.wftv.com/news/2604209/detail.html

So if you see a lion call the police so they can come pick it up and return it to it&apos;s owner.

Monday is the beginning of another week of work and school. No presentations or test this week ðŸ™‚
