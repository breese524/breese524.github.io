I&apos;ve finally found a home for my stuff!

When I moved to the new apartment, I unpacked most of my stuff and found a place for it. There were a lot of things I just piled into the office and my bedroom so I could just have them out of the way. Well now, I&apos;ve finally put all that stuff somewhere. It&apos;s either in the trash, or somewhere I can find it when I need it.

All this productivity is due to the lack of cable/internet for an entire week. I actually saw the situation as somewhat humorous. We survived the hurricane, even had cable for a week or so, then the cable randomly went out. It took them a whole week to fix the problem, whatever it was. In the meantime, I drove over to my co-worker&apos;s place for internet and working.

I think Monday or Tuesday night I will post all the pictures mentioned in previous posts. I have finally sorted through them and picked out the ones that were in focus and somewhat properly exposed. Now I just need to crop them and make them a reasonable size for the Internet.

Oh, there&apos;s yet another Cat. 4 hurricane out there. Hopefully it does not hit Florida, but we won&apos;t know anything until Wednesday at the earliest.

One last thing&#8230; I was looking at a friend&apos;s journal and found a quiz that was ok so here&apos;s the result&#8230;

You are Film.
  
You are the youngest of the art forms and you have  
a lot to prove. A blend of Photography and  
Drama, it&apos;s difficult to see you as a unique  
individual.
