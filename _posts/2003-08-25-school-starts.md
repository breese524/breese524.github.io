Classes begin today, but not for me ðŸ™‚ 

&#8220;So, what is your schedule?&#8221;, you ask.

Well, let&#8217;s see, I have bowling, strategic management (capstone) and weight lifting. This would be my last semester on campus and as such, I plan on having a little fun with class before I graduate.

I must go off to work now, b/c the bossman will wonder where I&#8217;ve gone I don&#8217;t go to work.
