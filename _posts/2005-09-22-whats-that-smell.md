I was just sitting here reading some friends blogs when I smelled something funny. Then, I realized what it was, I left some pizza in the toaster oven. Well, I will now find out if I like my pizza extra crispy.

In other news, I think I&#8217;m going to start targeting Atlanta, GA in my job search. I&#8217;m open to other areas as well, but I&#8217;m not that well traveled so I&#8217;m not sure what other areas I&#8217;d like.
