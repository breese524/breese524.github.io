So today there will be Hurricane Charlie, tomorrow there will be new sofas.

Everyone has been watching Charlie seeing where he will go, ect. I don&apos;t think it will be too bad here, just a lot of rain and a lot of wind, maybe some tornados, but we are not near mobile homes so we&apos;ll see if the tornado magnetism theory holds.

I really didn&apos;t do much to prepare for the storms. We put the stuff that was out side in the closet, I put gas in my car when I got back from WPB on Wednesday and we went to (gasp) Wal-Mart for some groceries.

So once the sofas come in tomorrow all I will need to do in the living area is find some sort of coffee table and end table, table lamp, a clock and some pictures for the bare walls.
