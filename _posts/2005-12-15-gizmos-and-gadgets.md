Over the past week or so, I have finally found a good use for my USB memory stick. It just so happens that portable software is seemingly making a come back. Portable software is software that can be installed on a device such as a memory stick and then run from more than one computer with out needing to be installed for each computer.

I have found it quite handy to have a couple of programs and, as I explore the available software, I&#8217;m sure I will find more useful stuff. The goal is to build a small library of essential tools. Since the drive is rather small, the binary packages must also remain on the small side.

So far, I have found a program called [PStart](http://www.pegtop.de/start/) which is be useful as a launch pad for other programs. It puts an icon in your task bar, you click on it and a menu pops up, much like clicking the start button in MS Windows. Since I work in different computing environments, I have found a simple mp3 player to be a handy tool to use to make a play list and play mp3s either from the drive or from a different disk. Currently, I&#8217;m using [Zoom Player](http://www.inmatrix.com/zplayer/). I have found the program to do the job well, but a little lacking in the different codecs it supports. I&#8217;m looking for a program that can store the codecs on the drive. The idea is to not rely on the host computer having specific software outside the operating system. Finally, I&#8217;m using [Wiz](http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/WiZ.html) to pack and unpack .zip files. Just today I needed to unpack a .zip file and the host computer did not have an unzip utility.
