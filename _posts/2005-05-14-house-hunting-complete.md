After 5 or 6 offers, all on very good first homes, I finally made an offer that was accepted. I found a nice townhome in the Casselberry area. It has 2 bedrooms and a loft that could be converted to a bedroom in the future as well as 2.5 bathrooms. The inspections have been completed, there are no major problems and no evidence of wood destroying organisms (termites, carpenter ants, etc.). The next step in the process is to secure all the financing. Once that is complete I will be closing on the property. The closing will probably be early June.

In other news&#8230;
  
The mission trip to NC went well. We built a playground for Camp Grace. I have lots of pictures, some taken by me, and more taken by others that went on the trip. Hopefully I will be able to post them soon.

In 2 weeks my littlest brother will be graduating from high school. I should be headed home for the graduation ceremony and will probably be there for a week, but I&#8217;ll still be working, so it&#8217;s no vacation.
