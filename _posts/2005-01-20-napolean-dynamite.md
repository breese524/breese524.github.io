This past Sunday I watched _Napolean Dynamite._ This was a very monotone movie, there was not much action and was really anti-climatic. I thought the movie was humorous, but it was not the funniest movie I had ever seen. Anyways, below is the results of a quiz that a [friend](http://www.livejournal.com/users/res_corporales/) posted in his journal.
