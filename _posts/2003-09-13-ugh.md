So, I have a cold.

Having a cold sucks, today is the UCF football home opener. Between my cold and all the stuff I need to get done for class and the career fair comming up, I don&apos;t think I will be able to go to the game. I really wanted to go to the game. There&apos;s just something about being at the game that I enjoy.

I&apos;ve been really busy with classes and Campus Crusade since school has started so, I haven&apos;t really had much time to even write a journal entry.
