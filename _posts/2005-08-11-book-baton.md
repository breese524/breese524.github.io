[Jason](http://www.jasongraphix.com) has thrown the book baton at me. It&#8217;s been a few weeks, but I don&#8217;t read as much as I used to so it took a while to jog the memory.

**Number of Books on the Shelves**
  
About 60 here, who knows how many of my books are in WPB

**Last Book Purchased**
  
The Object Oriented Thought Process, Matt Weisfeld

**Currently Reading**
  
The Object Oriented Thought Process, Matt Weisfeld

**Last 5 Books Read**
  
Food for Fitness, Chris Carmickael
  
The Five Love Languages for Singles, Gary Chapman
  
I don&#8217;t remember the last 5 books I&#8217;ve read, the two above are the most recent.

**Meaningful books**
  
The Bible is the most meaningful book I&#8217;ve read.

**Throwing the Book (Passing it to)** 
  
In random order&#8230;
