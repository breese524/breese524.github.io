We weathered the Hurricane as it came down through Orlando with it&apos;s category 2 winds, and we are just fine.

Here&apos;s a timeline for those who want to know&#8230;

5:00 p.m. We head over to Kristy and Kirsten&apos;s apartment to celebrate Carrie&apos;s birthday and wait out the storm.

8:30-ish p.m. The winds pick up, and the power begins to flicker of and on. There&apos;s no point in trying to watch the Olympic opening ceremony&apos;s and play Scrabble at the same time so we just leave the TV off.

9:20-ish p.m. The power flickers out for the last time during the storm.

11:30-ish p.m. We listened to the radio and find out that Charlie left florida so we went for a walk to check out the damage. In our apartment complex some fairly new trees had blown over. Two cars were hit by trees, but they were not damaged very much. It turns out our apartments did pretty good.

At some point after our wandering through the complex, I decided to drive over to Tim&apos;s along the way there were several downed trees, but apparent major structural damage. The driving around with no power was quite odd. Areas where I could drive without the headlights now required the hi-beam headlights. It&apos;s amazing how much light we put out.

I returned to the apartment at about 3:00 a.m. and went to sleep.

8:30 a.m. We got up and had cereal for breakfast and were wondering how long the milk will last before it goes sour.

9:00 a.m. We called home to let the parents know we are OK but without power. Then then proceeded to Waterford Lakes where I knew they had power. I figured I needed some cash just in case, and we got a radio and some batteries in case we were without power for more than the day.

11:00 a.m. The power was restored. We are still waiting for the cell phone services to stabilize and I&apos;m wondering if La-z-boy will attempt their furniture delivery.

I should have some pictures up fairly soon so you can see that things really weren&apos;t too bad this time.
