Well, another week has gone by. So here&apos;s some randomness to entertain you.

I went camping again on Friday/Saturday it only cost $5 for the site. That was a pretty good deal.

Saturday was cool. We had a gathering, if you will, at our apartment. We played the most randomly funny game of Crainium ever.

I got a little bored on Sunday night so I did some of those online quizzes. I found out that if I were a shoe, I&apos;d be a pair of soccer cleats and that my inner child is 10 years old.
