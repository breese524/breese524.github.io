Back in the days of my youth there was this commercial, it showed an egg in a frying pan. A narrator stated "This is your brain (egg in pain), this is your brain on drugs (egg frying)." This was the first PSA I remember. Since then anti-drug PSAs have changed, and there are several new ones advocating reading, not smoking etc.

Well today there was one advocating fitness&#8230; Here&apos;s a link [(Ad Council)](http://boss.streamos.com/real/adcouncil/healthy_lifestyles/cnhh4230-e01ny.smi?siteid=adcouncil) it requires RealPlayer. The scene opens with a guy bringing some flesh toned rubber material to a lobby desk. He says he found it by the stairs and wants to know what it is. The clerk says they&apos;re love handles and that lots of people lose them by taking the stairs. You really just have to watch the commercial. I guess we have now become so lazy that we need an advertising campaign to combat our lazyness.
