> WEST PALM BEACH &#8212; Nine touch-screen voting machines ran out of battery power and nearly 40 votes may have been lost in Palm Beach County, the first major problem reported on Election Day in the state that was the epicenter of the election fiasco four years ago.

> The machines at a Boynton Beach precinct weren&apos;t plugged in properly, and their batteries wore down about 9:30 a.m., said Marty Rogol, spokesman for Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Theresa LePore.

> Poll clerk Joyce Gold said 37 votes appeared to be missing after she compared the computer records to the sign-in sheet. Elections officials won&apos;t know exactly how many votes were lost until after polls close. (From the Orlando Sentinel) 

I have been saying for the past 4 years now that the electronic, touchscreen voting systems must print a receipt for it&apos;s votes. The article above is the prime reason why such a receipt is needed. It appears that 37 votes vanished into thin air b/c the machine lost power and had not saved the votes. How can one vote with such a system and be confident their vote counted? There&apos;s no paper to prove it.
