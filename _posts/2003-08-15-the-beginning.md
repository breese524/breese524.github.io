This would be the first entry in my &#8220;live&#8221; journal. I&#8217;ve decided that a live journal is sort of ironic because I will not be adding anything live.

So, what can you find here?
  
I&#8217;m not real sure at the moment. Since everyone will be able to see this, nothing to personal will be posted. I could expect to see summaries of things I did and maybe some rants about people or things that annoy me.

How often will you post?
  
I don&#8217;t know how often I will post, I could post everyday, or I could skip a few weeks. It all depends on how creative I feel.

Enjoy spying on me&#8211;
