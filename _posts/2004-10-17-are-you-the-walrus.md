I heard this song today. I think I&apos;m missing something from pop culture, but I&apos;m not sure. Who is the Walrus and why would you want to be the Walrus?

There are some other points in the song, but I really think I need to know who the Walrus is and why this guy is the Walrus&#8230;

Are You The Walrus?
  
by Furthermore

Album :

Check, check it out, check, check it out
  
Check, check it out, check, check it out
  
Check, check it out, check, check it out
  
Check it out

I&apos;m in line behind a barbizon
  
And she really looks like one
  
She says "Hi, I&apos;m skin,"
  
And showed a whole lot
  
But doesn&apos;t seem to have a whole lot
  
Within, I&apos;m small talk
  
Blah, blah, blah, blah about the weather and all
  
Because I&apos;d love to stand here
  
Another year, winter, spring, summer, fall
  
Into pieces it pleases the eye
  
It&apos;s nice to know that there are problems outside of my own

I feel better, better
  
Move to ten items or less
  
Should I let her, let her, let me in front of her?
  
Sure, I guess
  
I&apos;m close to checkout, she asks,
  
"Are you the walrus?"
  
I said "yes" without listening
  
"Oh, come on, be honest."
  
I&apos;m close to checkout, she asks,
  
"Are you the walrus?"
  
I said, "Yes, and that&apos;s a promise!"
  
"Oh, come on, be honest."
  
Be, be honest, be, be, be honest
  
Be, be honest, be, be, be honest

I have five items in the waiting asylum
  
Take everybody&apos;s burdens, let&apos;s pile &apos;em up
  
On the counter, call it a conveyer belt
  
And as I look around I see a wanna-be dad using his belt
  
On his screaming baby, a baby, oh baby
  
The constellation on her face said he did the same to his lady
  
Ten thousand maniacs asked the question
  
But it&apos;s way too late, he made a lasting impression
  
I wish it wasn&apos;t so, I wish it wasn&apos;t so
  
But I&apos;m not supposed to impose family values, you know
  
The sale of the century wasn&apos;t meant to be like this
  
But how can you resist the madness?
  
I&apos;m so glad it&apos;s almost my turn
  
Only one lady away from the freedom I yearn for
  
But before you get excited,
  
She&apos;s gotta check the writing,
  
I&apos;m sorry to announce that the check is gonna bounce

I feel better, better
  
Move to ten items or less
  
Should I let her, let her, let me in front of her?
  
Sure I guess
  
I&apos;m at the checkout
  
She asks, "Are you the walrus?"
  
I said "yes" without listening
  
"Oh, come on, be honest."
  
I&apos;m at the checkout,
  
She asks, "Are you the walrus?"
  
I said, "Yes, and that&apos;s a promise."
  
"Oh, come on, be honest."
  
Be, be honest, be, be, be honest
  
Be, be honest, be, be, be honest

Honestly,
  
We are moderately moving
  
Situation slowly is improving
  
I find the Percy Faith on the P.A.
  
Is sort of soothing
  
Collect my change and I jet
  
Then I&apos;m cruising

Check, check it out, check, check it out
  
Check, check it out, check, check it out
  
Check, check it out, check, check it out
  
Check it out

Wandering around looking for my car
  
I&apos;m amazed at the maze
  
Who even knows where you are?
  
Who knows why that&apos;s a cart resting in the dent it made?
  
Another car waiting for our places to trade
  
I wish it wasn&apos;t so, I wish it wasn&apos;t so
  
I wish I was in the distance and heading to home base
  
And now the race to red lights begin
  
When the convertible girl slows down to let me in

I feel better, better, like as if I was blessed
  
Should I let her, let her, let me in front of her?
  
Sure, I guess
  
I roll down the window, she asks,
  
"Are you the walrus?"
  
I said "yes" without listening
  
"Oh, come on, be honest"
  
I roll down the window, she asks,
  
"Are you the walrus?"
  
I said "Yes, and that&apos;s a promise!"
  
"Oh, come on, be honest."
  
Be, be honest, be, be, be honest
  
Be, be honest, be, be, be honest
