While I was rushing myself out the door to go home for Chrsitmas I neglected to pack a few essential items. One of those was the sync. cable for my phone. Thankfully this phone has an IR port as well so I can sync. it using that as well, but it takes for ever and a day to download all the data I had backed up.

If you&#8217;re using a Treo, never leave home with out the cables and never let the battery run out completely.
