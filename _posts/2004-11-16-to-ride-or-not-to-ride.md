While I wasn&#8217;t a huge fan of mountain bike racing, it could have been b/c Carter RD is one of the most challenging trails in the state and to be honest, I didn&#8217;t have the skills. Nonetheless I have not given up on mountain biking. Over the past few weeks I&#8217;ve decided to start preparing for, the 3rd [Tour De Felasco](http://www.sanfelasco.net/docs/tour2005.pdf), a 50 mile trail ride through the <a href = "http://www.sanfelasco.net/">San Felasco Hammock Preserve State Park</a>. I saw this as a challenage. It&#8217;s not a race, so it&#8217;s just a matter of finishing. Recently, I found out about the [IDIDARIDE](http://www.suwanneebike.org/ididaride.htm), which is another 50 mile ride going down in the Suwannee River region (North FL where I-10 and I-75 intersect) put on by the [Suwannee Bicycle Association](http://www.suwanneebike.org/).

I like the idea of these epic rides and am wondering if I could be physically prepared to do two of these rides in 2 weeks. Which then raises the question of whether or not I&#8217;d want to participate in a 12 hr team relay ride that normally happens in late February or early March. The team relay ride is different in that most teams have a one lap rotation.

Getting back to the subject of this entry. The question is whether or not I should go for riding the Suwannee IDIDARIDE in addition to the Tour De Felasco. I think it is possible to do both, I&#8217;m just not 100% sure I want to do both rides.
