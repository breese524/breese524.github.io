Massive progress has been made!

Today I have implemented a new theme.

The theme, Bluedot, was listed here: [alexking.org.](http://www.alexking.org/index.php?content=software/wordpress/styles.php) It was desiged by [Riosoft.](http://eriosoft.com/portal/modules/news/) I made some minor changes to their design, but the majority of the design is theirs.

I&#8217;m not sure what else I will need to do with this theme to make it look how I want, but I&#8217;m sure I will tweak it over time.

[WordPress](http://wordpress.org) has a new method of making themes in their upcoming version. You just have to copy up the css and template file the themes folder and select the new theme. It is fairly simple to use.

Soon I will tackle the comment spam issues and move my [LiveJournal](http://live-journal.com/) &#8211; [Angular Thoughts](http://Live-Journal.com/users/breese524/) over to this Web site. After I have all my old content moved I will work on creating a photo album.
