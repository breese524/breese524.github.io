So long 2005. Hello 2006.

In honor of the new year, I suppose this will be a 2005 top 10 things happened in my life.

10. Was rearended by a drunk driver
  
9. Removed popcorn ceiling texture
  
8. Discovered that I can use Linux for 90% of my computing activities
  
7. Almost bought a house
  
6. No longer working for BestWorks and becoming a contractor
  
5. Family reunion/road trip
  
4. IDIDARIDE 2005 50 miles of off-road cycling in N. FL
  
3. On CBM trip, blowing a tire on the way home
  
2. Going to NC and building a playground for CBM
  
1. Rafting in Ocoee, TN with friends

I don&#8217;t make New Year&#8217;s Resolutions. I forget what they are after a month so I don&#8217;t see the point. This new year will certainly be interesting as I have a lot of things that could be happening.
