Due to some changes in my life, it turns out I will not be able to buy a house. There is more to this story that can be released at a later date, but right now, all that I feel is appropriate to be said in public is that changes are coming up in my life, once some things stabilize, I&#8217;ll be able to discuss it more openly.

In the mean time, here&#8217;s a neat little thing&#8230;

<table cellspacing="0" align="center">
  <tr>
    <td style="font: bolder small-caps 14pt Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif; color: black; text-transform: capitalize; word-spacing: .3em; text-align: center; background: #bce9ff; border-style: double; border-color: gray; padding: 5px; width: 350px;">
      Your Birthdate: May 24
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td style="	font: small-caps small-caps 12pt Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif; color: black; text-transform: none; text-align: left; background: #e2f5ff; border-style: double; border-color: gray; padding: 5px; width: 350px;">
      Born on the 24th, you have a greater capacity for responsibility and helping others than your may have realized. </p> 
      
      <p>
        You may also become the mediator and peacemaker in inharmonious situations.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Devoted to family, you tend to manage and protect.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This birth date adds to the emotional nature and perhaps to the sensitivities.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Affections are important to you; both the giving and the receiving.</td> </tr> </table>
