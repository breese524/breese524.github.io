This is a rare more personal entry.

I thought that once I graduated from college life would be easier. In someways, life is easier, I don&apos;t stress over classes and grades but, I find that I&apos;m still really busy, and the stress of deadlines, real and self made, can more than make up for the classes and grades. Then there are life issues to be taken care of as well, I recently moved to my own apartment (sort of, my brother is renting with me) I needed to buy furniture, plus setup my home office (which still isn&apos;t finished).

Then there are weekends like this last one. On Friday, I found myself packing and preparing to leave for Clearwater. Yet again a friend of mine is getting married. As we arrived late in Clearwater, we hurried on over to the church for the wedding rehearsal, then the rehearsal dinner and finally, the bachlor party. We got back to the hotel around 2:30 a.m. Saturday. We had to get up at 9 a.m. for the wedding, which was excellent. Then the reception. I have learned that being in the wedding party doesn&apos;t end after the wedding. If your in the wedding party, it is your responsibility to help get the party started at the reception.

We had a lot of fun at the reception. Danny and Dawn will be a great couple. I&apos;m sure they will be happy together. There was a return of the "Rowboat" at the recepetion. If I get a picture of it, I will have to post it. I think any wedding that Jason is at will not be complete without the "Rowboat."

After the reception, we paid Andrew and Monica a visit. We went to get ice cream at a historic hotel on the bay. We had a small adventure trying to figure out how to get out of the parking lot. I can&apos;t wait for everyone to return to Orlando so we can hang out.

Finally, Sunday. Today, I got up and went to church. I found out the band needed a crossover for their gig that night. I called my friend, Mike, to see if I could borrow his. I had to leave the second service early and run back to my apartment to get my key to Mike&apos;s. Then, I needed to stop at Mike&apos;s and get the crossover. By the time I got to the church it was time to load up and go to the gig. The band played well and the crowd seemed to like the worship music. Once it was over, we packed it all down and here I am writing this.

So, back to beginning. I have found that even though I&apos;ve graduated from college I still find myself quite busy.

Time to get some rest&#8230;
